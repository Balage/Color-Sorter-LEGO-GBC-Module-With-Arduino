# Color Sorter LEGO GBC Module With Arduino
The Arduino code for my Color Sorter GBC module.

## How to install code
- Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- The Arduino IDE by default stores all Sketches in a folder named **"Arduino"** in your **Documents** folder.
- Download the repository and copy the entire **"LEGO_GBC_Color_Sorter"** folder to there.
- Start the Arduino IDE and select **"File"**, **"Sketches"**, and then choose **"LEGO_GBC_Color_Sorter"** from the list.

## How to upload sketch to the Arduino Uno
- After the Arduino Uno board is plugged in, go to "Tools", "Board", then select "Arduino Uno".
- Go to "Tools" again, then "Port", and select the (hopefully) only port that is **not** "COM1".
- Start Upload with the right-arrow icon on the menu bar.
- The console at the bottom will say "Compiling sketch...", then "Uploading...", and finally "Done uploading".
